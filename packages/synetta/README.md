# Synetta

## Getting Started

This is a work in progress, please come back later !

## Development

The build process is handled manually using a [`build.ts` file](./build.ts) and [`tsx`](https://npmjs.com/package/tsx) to run it.

```bash
# In case dependencies are not installed.
pnpm install

# Build the project and output it in `dist` folder.
pnpm build
```
